```

## Notes

- Slash commands
    - Discord will sort commands alphabetically, regardless of their initial order in the `config.yml` file.
    - Users will instantly see commands once registered because this project uses [guild commands](https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands#registering-a-command) instead of global ones.
    - Discord has a global rate limit of [200 application command creations per day, per guild](https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands#registering-a-command).
    - The bot will automatically register slash commands on startup.
    - Registered commands can be removed by the `discord:clean` CLI command.
    - Only one sub-command level is supported; for example, `/foo bar` is valid.
- Markdown content
    - The content of each file can be up to 2000 characters.
    - The bot caches the content after execution (restarting is required to apply the changes).
- Moderators
    - They can be defined by their unique Discord ID in the `config.yml` file.
    - They bypass rate-limit policies.
    - They can execute `protected` commands in the `config.yml` file.
