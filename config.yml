# This configuration is for rate limiting usage of slash commands
#
# `ttl` specifies the maximum time to live (in seconds) for each usage of a slash command,
# after which the usage count will reset to 0
#
# `usage` specifies the maximum number of times a particular slash command can be used within the `ttl` period
# before further usage is prevented
#
ratelimit:
  ttl: 60  # Maximum TTL of 60 seconds
  usage: 8 # Maximum of 8 usages within the TTL period
