# This configuration is for rate limiting usage of slash commands
#
# `ttl` specifies the maximum time to live (in seconds) for each usage of a slash command,
# after which the usage count will reset to 0
#
# `usage` specifies the maximum number of times a particular slash command can be used within the `ttl` period
# before further usage is prevented
#
ratelimit:
  ttl: 60  # Maximum TTL of 60 seconds
  usage: 8 # Maximum of 8 usages within the TTL period
  message:
    "Chill out, cowboy!\nYou don't want to overload our poor server."

#
# This configuration block defines dynamic slash commands to be displayed to Discord users.
#
commands:
  #
  # For each command, use a key to define the command name.
  # If a key contains a single space character, it becomes a sub-command.
  #
  #   example sub-command:
  #     description: "This is my command"
  #     content: "./content/my-command.md"
  #     protected: false
  #     buttons:
  #       -
  #         - label: "Button 1"
  #           url: "https://button1.com/"
  #           emoji: "🔗"
  #         - label: "Button 2"
  #           url: "https://button2.com/"
  #           emoji: "🔗"
  #
  # The properties for each command are as follows:
  #
  #   description (required, max 100 characters):
  #     A short description of the command.
  #
  #   content (required):
  #     The path to the markdown file containing detailed information about the command.
  #     The file should be located in the "content" folder, as the Docker volume relies on this.
  #
  #   protected (optional, default is false):
  #     If set to true, only moderators will be able to see this command.
  #
  #   buttons (optional, max 8 rows, max 4 columns):
  #     An array of arrays representing rows and columns of Discord message components, specifically link buttons.
  #     Each link button has a label, URL, and optional emoji.
  #     See https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/message-components for more information on message components.
