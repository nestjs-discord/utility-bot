A hybrid application is one that both listens for HTTP requests, and makes use of connected microservices. The `INestApplication` instance can be connected with `INestMicroservice` instances through the `connectMicroservice()` method.

```typescript
const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule);
const microservice = app.connectMicroservice<MicroserviceOptions>({
  transport: Transport.TCP,
});

await app.startAllMicroservices();
await app.listen(3001);
```
