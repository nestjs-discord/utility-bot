Along with just manually verifying your dependencies are correct, as of Nest 8.1.0 you can set the `NEST_DEBUG` environment variable to a string that resolves as truthy, and get extra logging information while Nest is resolving all the dependencies for the application[.](https://docs.nestjs.com/assets/injector_logs.png)

The string in yellow is the host class of the dependency being injected, the string in blue is the name of the injected dependency, or its injection token, and the string in purple is the module in which the dependency is being searched for. Using this, you can usually trace back the dependency resolution for what's happening and why you're getting dependency injection problems.
