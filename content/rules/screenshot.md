:warning: Please **do not screenshot code** as it causes a number of issues:

1) **Ease of assistance** - If someone wants to copy your code and correct it, they cannot. Making it easy for people to help you is in your best interests.
2) **Editorializing** - It's common to try to make images small, which means you're likely to crop out code relevant to your issue
3) **Accessibility** - Wide images can be hard to read on mobile devices, and are impossible for screen readers.
4) **Legibility** - You cannot read screenshots of code directly, instead you have to open them in an enlarged context.
5) **Bandwidth usage/clutter** - Some of our members use metered connections, and it is wasteful for them to download images of text.

For a small amount of code please use a code-block (`/rules codeblocks`).
