:warning: Please **do not screenshot code** as it causes a number of issues:

- Ease of assistance: if someone wants to copy your code and correct it, they cannot. Making it easy for people to help you is in your best interests.
- Editorializing: it's common to try to make images small, which means you're likely to crop out code relevant to your issue
- Accessibility: wide images can be hard to read on mobile devices, and are impossible for screen readers.
- Legibility: you cannot read screenshots of code directly, instead you have to open them in an enlarged context.
- Bandwidth usage/clutter: some of our members use metered connections, and it is wasteful for them to download images of a text.

For a small amount of code, please use a code-block.
