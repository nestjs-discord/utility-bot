⚠️ Please __**do not screenshot code**__ as it causes a number of issues:
1) __**Ease of assistance**__ - If someone wants to copy your code and correct it, they cannot.  Making it easy for people to help you is in your best interests.
2) __**Editorializing**__ - It's common to try to make images small in size, which means you're likely to crop out code relevant to your issue
3) __**Accessibility**__ - Wide images can be hard to read on mobile devices, and are impossible for screen readers.
4) __**Legibility**__ - You cannot read screenshots of code directly, instead you have to open them in an enlarged context.
5) __**Bandwidth usage/clutter**__ - Some of our members use metered connections and it is wasteful for them to download images of text.

For a small amount of code please use a codeblock (`/codeblocks`), while an external repository (see `/code`) is suitable for larger codebase.
