When asking for help with a problem, don't just say, "X doesn't work" or "Y did not fix it" actually describe the error.
If there is an error message, share it. If it did not function as expected, describe how it behaved and how you expected it to behave.
If you haven't already, or haven't recently, share the code that is not working and any code we may need to help diagnose the error.
